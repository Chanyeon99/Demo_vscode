            <p> Consider the size for the main size,  because the main axis is horizontal, so the main size is horizontal, so use: 
                Flex-basis: 
                Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:Block, for sections in a webpage
                Inline, for text
                Table, for two-dimensional table data
                Positioned, for explicit position of an element
                The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

            <p>For example, if you want to create a two-column layout for most screen sizes, and a one-column layout for small screen sizes (such as phones and tablets), you can change the flex-direction from row to column at a specific breakpoint (800px in the example below):<br>
                Example<br>
                .flex-container {<br>

                /* Responsive layout - makes a one column layout instead of a two-column layout */<br>
                @media (max-width: 800px) {<br>
                  .flex-container {<br>
